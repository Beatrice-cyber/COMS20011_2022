# Data Driven Computer Science (DDCS; COMS20011)

The course will teach the basics of how to reason with data.

## Staff
- [Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/) [laurence.aitchison@bristol.ac.uk] (unit director)
- [Majid Mirmehdi](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~majid/) [m.mirmehdi@bristol.ac.uk]

## Schedule:
* Lectures:
  - Monday 2pm in QUEENS BLDG 1.40 PUGSLEY
  - Thursday 1pm in CHEM BLDG LT1
* Labs (starting 2nd Feb).  To tell what group you're in look in your Outlook calendar.  You will see one of the following two slots:
  - Group 1: Thursday 4-5pm in MVB 2.11
  - Group 2: Thursday 5-6pm in MVB 2.11

## Labs:
* The labs are starting on Feb 2nd, so there will be no lab on 26th Jan.
* The labs come with exercises as Python notebook.  A new set of exercises will be released every _two_ weeks.  (So there will be a new notebook on 2nd Feb and Feb 16th but _not_ 9th Feb).
* Material in the labs may appear in the exam.
* *The labs are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, any question sheets and exams, not just the labs!!!!*
* The lab exercises will be released in the /labs/ folder.

## Other information:
* The Teams Team is "COMS20011: Data-Driven Computer Science 2022/23".  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the school office (coms-info@bristol.ac.uk)!
* The course is assessed 100% by exam.  The exam is in-person multiple-choice.

## Routes for feedback:
* TA led sessions on Thursday 4-5 (group 1) or 5-6 (group 2) (you should have one of these slots in your calendar).  You can ask about all aspects of the course lectures, labs and exams.  We have a room for these (MVB 2.11), and some support will be available in the room.  We may also have support available online.  The first lab session is on 2nd Feb (there will be no session on Jan 26th).
* You can ask questions on the Teams General Channel.
* We may use a few of the lecture slots as online QA slots (there will be an email beforehand about this).

## Alternative resources
Important: these are not pre-requisites!  The course material should be fully self-contained.  But some of this may be useful if you want an alternative presentations of some of the material and/or if you have a general interest in data-science.  Feel free to raise an issue/pull-request if you have recommendations for other resources.

#### Probabilistic machine learning (relevant for Laurence's part of the course):
  * [Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) [pdf](https://github.com/probml/pml-book/releases/latest/download/book1.pdf) (Parts I - III are most relevant.  Obviously that's quite a bit, ranging from fundamentals to deep learning.  But different people will find different bits most relevant).

#### Probability and statistics
  * A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Understanding Why and How (Dekking et al.)
  * [[MIT OpenCourseWare]](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/)
  * [[Khan Academy]](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) (from Probability)

#### Calculus:
